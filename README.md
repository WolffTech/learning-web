# LearningWeb Development Notes

This is a repository full of stuff that I have worked on while learning web development. This repository is for me to be able to reference back to when I need it to refresh my memory or to review a concept. I have not yet completed all of the projects, but I am continually working on them. I have also included notes and exercises that I have written to help me remember the concepts.

Listed below is the structure of the repository...
